This script provides analysis in JupyterLab for microbiome community composition data composed of alpha and beta diversity as well as OTU inhibition of tadpole skin microbiomes exposed to varying concentrations and duration of exposure to a cell-free metabolite based prophylactic of the amphibian-specific fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. This can be applied to other microbiome community compositions with similar diversity metrics and microbiome sequence data that has been assessed for inhibitory capabilities against a specific pathogen. 
To run: download Python script and metadata CSV file (frogs.csv) into a single directory. Metadata can be obtained from the supplementary data here: https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/suppl/10.1098/rstb.2022.0126
